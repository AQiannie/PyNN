Bug reports and feature requests
================================

If you find a bug or would like to add a new feature to PyNN, the first thing to
do is to create a ticket for it at https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/PyNN/issues/new
(You will need a GitHub account).

If you know how to fix the bug, please attach a patch to the ticket, and please
also provide a unit test that fails with the original code and passes when your
patch is applied. If you would like commit rights for the Subversion repository,
please contact us.

If you do have commit rights, please make sure *all* the tests pass before you
make a commit.
