Simulation control
==================

Initialising the simulator
==========================

Before using any other functions or classes from PyNN, the user must call the
:func:`setup()` function::

    >>> setup()

:func:`setup()` takes various optional arguments: setting the simulation
timestep (there is currently no support in the API for variable timestep methods
although native simulator code can be used to select this option where the
simulator supports it) and setting the minimum and maximum synaptic delays, e.g.::

    >>> setup(timestep=0.1, min_delay=0.1, max_delay=10.0)

Calling :func:`setup()` a second time resets the simulator entirely, destroying
any network that may have been created in the meantime.

Getting information about the simulation state
==============================================

Several functions are available for obtaining information about the simulation
state:

    * :func:`get_current_time` - the time within the simulation
    * :func:`get_time_step` - the integration time step
    * :func:`get_min_delay` - the minimum allowed synaptic delay
    * :func:`get_max_delay` - the maximum allowed synaptic delay
    * :func:`num_processes` - the number of MPI processes
    * :func:`rank` - the MPI rank of the current node

Running a simulation
====================

The :meth:`run()` function advances the simulation for a given number of milliseconds, e.g.::

    >>> run(1000.0)
    
You can also use :meth:`run_for()`, which is an alias for :meth:`run()`. The :meth:`run_until()`
function advances the simulation until a given future time point, e.g.::

    >>> run_until(1001.0)
    >>> get_current_time()
    1001.0


Repeating a simulation
======================

If you wish to reset network time to zero to run a new simulation with the same
network (with different parameter values, perhaps), use the :func:`reset()` function.
Note that this does not change the network structure, nor the choice of which
neurons to record (from previous :meth:`record()` calls).

Finishing up
============

Just as a simulation must be begun with a call to ``setup()``, it should be
ended with a call to ``end()``. This is not always necessary, but it is safest
to always use it.
