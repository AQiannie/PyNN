Recording spikes and state variables
====================================

It is possible to record the times of action potentials, and the values of
state variables, of any neuron in the model. Recording state variables of
dynamic synapse models is not yet supported.

The classes :class:`Population`, :class:`PopulationView` and :class:`Assembly`
all have a :meth:`record` method, which takes either a single variable name or
a list/tuple of such names, and which sets up recording of the requested variables
for all neurons in the population::

    >>> population.record(['v', 'spikes']) # record membrane potential and spikes from all neurons in the population
    >>> assembly.record('spikes')          # record spikes from all neurons in multiple populations

To record from only a subset of the neurons in a :class:`Population`, we create
a temporary :class:`PopulationView` using indexing or the :meth:`sample` method
and call :meth:`record` on this view::

    >>> population.sample(10).record('v')  # record membrane potential from 10 neurons chosen at random
    >>> population[[0,1,2]].record(['v', 'gsyn_exc', 'gsyn_inh']) # record several variables from specific neurons

To find out what variable names are available for a given neuron model, inspect
the :attr:`recordable` attribute of the population's :attr:`celltype` attribute::

    >>> population.celltype
    EIF_cond_alpha_isfa_ista
    >>> population.celltype.recordable
    ['spikes', 'v', 'w', 'gsyn_exc', 'gsyn_inh']
