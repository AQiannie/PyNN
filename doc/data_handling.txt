Data handling
=============

.. todo: add a note that data handling has changed considerably since 0.7,
         and give link to detailed changelog.

Recorded data in PyNN is always associated with the :class:`Population` or
:class:`Assembly` from which it was recorded. Data may either be written to
file, using the :meth:`write_data` method, or retrieved as objects in memory,
using :meth:`get_data`.


Retrieving recorded data
========================

Handling of recorded data in PyNN makes use of the Neo_ package, which provides
a common Python data model for neurophysiology data (whether real or simulated).

The :meth:`get_data` method returns a Neo :class:`Block` object. This is the
top-level data container, which contains one or more :class:`Segment`\s. Each
:class:`Segment` is a container for data sharing a common time basis - a new
:class:`Segment` is added every time the :func:`reset` function is called.

A :class:`Segment` can contain lists of :class:`AnalogSignal`,
:class:`AnalogSignalArray` and :class:`SpikeTrain` objects. These data objects
inherit from NumPy's array class, and so can be treated in further processing
(analysis, visualization, etc.) in exactly the same way as NumPy arrays, but in
addition they carry metadata about units, sampling interval, etc.

Here is a complete example of recording and plotting data from a simulation:

.. plot:: pyplots/neo_example.py
   :include-source:


The adoption of Neo as an output representation also makes it easier to handle
data when running multiple simulations with the same network, calling
:meth:`reset` between each run. In previous versions of PyNN it was necessary to
retrieve the data before every :meth:`reset`, and take care of storing the
resulting data. Now, each run just creates a new Neo ``Segment``, and PyNN takes
care of storing the data until it is needed. This is illustrated in the example
below.

.. note:: if you still want to retrieve the data after every run you can do so:
          just call `get_data(clear=True)`

.. plot:: pyplots/reset_example.py
   :include-source:


Writing data to file
====================

Neo provides support for writing to a `variety of different file formats`_,
notably an assortment of text-based formats, NumPy binary format,
Matlab :file:`.mat` files, and HDF5. To write to a given format, we create a Neo
:class:`IO` object and pass it to the meth:`write_data` method:

.. testsetup::

    import os
    import pyNN.mock as sim
    sim.setup()
    population = sim.Population(10, sim.IF_cond_exp())
    population.record(['spikes', 'v'])
    sim.run(0.2)
    if os.path.exists("my_data.h5"):
        os.remove("my_data.h5")

.. doctest::

    >>> from neo.io import NeoHdf5IO
    >>> io = NeoHdf5IO(filename="my_data.h5")
    >>> population.write_data(io)

.. todo: check whether we need to close the `io` object.

As a shortcut, for file formats with a well-defined file extension, it is
possible to pass just the filename, and PyNN will create the appropriate
:class:`IO` object for you:

.. doctest::

    >>> population.write_data("my_data.mat")  # writes to a Matlab file

By default, all the variables that were specified in the :meth:`record` call
will be saved to file, but it is also possible to save only a subset of the
recorded data:

.. doctest::

    >>> population.write_data(io, variables=('v', 'gsyn_exc'))

When running distributed simulations using MPI (see :doc:`parallel`), by default
the data is gathered from all MPI nodes to the master node, and only saved to
file on the master node. If you would prefer that each node saves its own
local subset of the data to disk separately, use *gather=False*:

.. doctest::

    >>> population.write_data(io, gather=False)

Saving data to a file does not delete the data from the :class:`Population`
object. If you wish to do so (for example to release memory), use *clear=True*:

.. doctest::

    >>> population.write_data(io, clear=True)

.. testcleanup::

    import os
    for filename in ("my_data.h5", "my_data.mat"):
        if os.path.exists(filename):
            os.remove(filename)
