============

Installing Python
=================

We assume this is installed on your machine already. If not, we suggest you install it via the package manager of your Linux distribution [OS X instructions?]. If this is not possible, go to `<http://www.python.org>`_ and follow the instructions you find there.

Installing NEURON
=================

Download the sources for the latest release of NEURON, in ``.tar.gz`` format, from `<http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/install/install.html>`_. Also download Interviews from the same location.

Compile Interviews and NEURON according to the instructions given at `<http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/install/compile_unix.html#fullinstall>`_ [what about OS X?], except that when you run ``configure``, add the options ``--with-nrnpython`` and ``--with-mpi`` (the latter assumes you have the MPICH library installed on your machine [should we give instructions?]), i.e.::

    $ ./configure --prefix=`pwd` --with-nrnpython --with-mpi
    $ make
    $ make install

Make sure that you add the Interviews and NEURON bin directories to your path. Test that the Python support has been enabled by running::

    $ nrniv -python
    insert NEURON output here
    >>> import hoc
    >>> import nrn   

Installing NEST and PyNEST
==========================

Installing PyNN
===============

A link to download PyNN can be found on the `PyNN homepage`_.



enter the ``hoc`` directory and run ``nrnivmodl``
