"""
Provides a Population of spike sources with firing rate correlations.

We suppose there is a point stimulus whose position jumps about rapidly in space.
The mean firing rate of each neuron at a given point in time depends on the
position of the stimulus within its receptive field (bell-shaped tuning curve).
For a given mean firing rate, each neuron generates spikes according to a
Poisson process (i.e., overall, each neuron generates an inhomogenous Poisson
process with step changes in mean rate).

The names `babble` and `BabblingPopulation` come from this random jumping about,
which is analogous to verbal babbling and to the apparently random limb
movements made by newborn infants ('motor babbling').

Several populations can 'observe' the same stimulus - this is implemented by
a `sync` argument which gives the population whose `stim_positions` and
`position_changes` attributes should be used.

Arbitrary transformations can be applied to the stimulus positions, e.g.
consider observing a stimulus through prism glasses.

The current version has periodic boundary conditions.
