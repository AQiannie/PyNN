------------------------------------------------------------------------
r262 | apdavison | 2008-03-21 15:23:41 +0100 (Fri, 21 Mar 2008) | 1 line

Reimplemented `Population.set()`, `tset()`, `rset()` in a more consistent way which avoids exposing the translation machinery and fixes various bugs with computed parameters. The new implementation is likely to be slower, but several optimisations are possible.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added `simple_parameters()`, `scaled_parameters()` and `computed_parameters()` methods to the `StandardModelType` class. Their intended use is in making `set()` methods/functions more efficient for non-computed parameters when setting on many nodes.

Fixed bug #36 for `nest2` and `neuron` (did not occur with `nest1` and `pcsim`). If you mix `Population.record()` and the function `record()`, I think it is still possible to record a cell twice, but this is unlikely to be done by accident.

The previous commit should have had all these changes as well...

Significant refactoring of parameter setting and getting:

* Changed `common.ID` to `common.IDMixin`, which allows the type used for the id to vary (int for `neuron` and `nest1/2`, long for pcsim).

* In `common.StandardModelType`, changed most of the methods to be classmethods, since they do not act on instance data.

* Greatly simplified the parameter translation mechanism, by moving most of the code into `common.ID`. This allowed me to find lots of bugs in the various `cells.py`. `set()` and the various `Population` set methods have not yet been updated.

* made `list_standard_models()` more robust. It now lists only those it is able to instantiate.

* commented out `IF_cond_alpha` in `nest1.cells.py` because the `iaf_cond_neuron` model does not have an offset current parameter. Need to add a model to pynest to fix this.

A few of the unittests have been broken, but it seemed best to commit at this point.

Added a `dendritic_delay_fraction` argument (float between 0 and 1) to the `STDPMechanism` class. For point neurons and purely spike-based STDP rules, if we assume that the total delay between a spike occuring at the presynaptic cell soma/axon initial segment and the beginning of the EPSC at the postsynaptic soma is the sum of `d_axon`, `d_transmission` and `d_dendrite`, then `dendritic_delay_fraction=0` is equivalent to assuming that the back-propagating postsynaptic spike is felt instantaneously at the synapse (i.e. `d_dendrite` is zero) and `dendritic_delay_fraction=1` is equivalent to assuming that `d_axon` and `d_transmission` are both zero. In both cases we assume that forward transmission of the EPSP has the same delay as the back-propagating action potential, i.e. `d_dendrite==d_BPAP`.

Ideally, `dendritic_delay_fraction` should be able to vary on a per-connection basis (since `d_dendrite` should be more-or-less constant for a given cell class whereas `d_axon` is a function of the distance between the neurons), but until the underlying simulators support storing separate values for the axonal, transmission and dendritic delays, rather than a single 'synaptic' delay value, we make this value constant for all connections in a `Projection`.

Added a test to check that the `neuron` and `nest2` STDP implementations give comparable results.

In the `neuron.__init__` module, filenames are now popped from the spikefilelist and vfilelist when writing to file in `end()`. This addresses the problem noted in #43, but still does not allow the example script attached to that issue to run. The root problem is that the `neuron` module was really designed to have `setup()` and `end()` run only once per script. I have opened a new ticket (#45) to address this.

Finally moved `StandardCellType.translate1()` to `translate()`.

Added call of `self.translate()` to `StandardCellType.__init__()`, which allows the __init__() method of derived classes to be undefined unless extra, non-standard parameters need to be added to `self.parameters` (I think - I haven't tested this yet, due to working on a machine with no simulators installed).

A multitude of small, cosmetic (coding-style) changes, like adding spaces after commas, to reduce the number of complaints from pylint!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r230 | apdavison | 2008-02-19 11:15:22 +0100 (Tue, 19 Feb 2008) | 5 lines

Changes in `nest2`:
 * Added `getWeights()` and `getDelays()` methods. These reduce duplicate code in `printWeight()` and `saveConnections()`, and are also useful in their own right: to be added to API.
 * Created private functions `_get_connection()` and `set_connection()` as wrappers around `nest.GetConnection()` and `nest.SetConnection()`. These are needed as PyNEST does not raise an Exception if cell ids, parameter names or parameter values are invalid. Now we can be sure that if we set a value, it actually gets set. `_get_connections()` and `set_connections()` might also be useful, but first we need to resolve the problem that `Population`s (and therefore cells) can belong to multiple `Projection`s, and so the connections returned with `GetConnections()` not specific to the `Projection` we are interested in (also see #42).
* Added a RoundingWarning exception to `common` - it's nice to be warned when this is occurring.
* Added a few more tests to exercise `GetWeights()`, etc

Modification to [source:src/hoc/vecstim.mod vecstim.mod] to allow changing the spike_times during a simulation without reinitialising. Mechanism (mechanism pings itself at intervals to check if the spike vector has changed) is rather wasteful and can also drop spikes following changes if the ping interval is too large, but I think the gain outweighs these problems.

MAJOR CHANGES: merged multifile branch to trunk. The main changes:

(1) Simulator modules have been moved to a `src` subdirectory - this is to make distribution/installation of PyNN easier.

(2) Several of the modules have been split into multiple files, in their own subdirectories, e.g.: `nest2.py` --> `nest2/__init__.py`, `nest2/cells.py` and `nest2/connectors.py`. The reason for this is that the individual files were getting very long and difficult to navigate. It is not required, though. For example, I have kept `neuroml.py` as a single file because it was not too long. This change has broken a couple of the `neuron` unittests`, and I haven't run the `VAbenchmarks` test, but otherwise everything seems to work.

Tidying up before merging multifile branch
* implemented `Population.index()` method in `nest2`. 
* Added more header information in 'compatible_output' mode (in `nest2`, needs to be changed in the other modules as well. 
* Small bug-fix in `neuron` implementation of new STDP API

The implementations of `FixedNumberPreConnector` and `FixedNumberPostConnector` (see r166, r167) were broken (notably for the case of multiple projections between two populations). Here is a new implementation, which I haven't thoroughly thought through, let alone tested, but I think the `start_ports`, `end_ports` idea could be a generic mechanism (i.e. move out of `Connector` and into `Projection`) for storing connection information (replacing `_sources`, `_targets`, `_targetPorts`).
Need to (a) write a unit test for the non-parallel case, (b) test the parallel case.

Add the FixedNumberPre Post connector to the common.py API and implement them only for PCSIM (easy to do for nest, code is already there). Modification of the connectors objects to receive weights and delays as arguments on the command line, and an object WDManager has been created to automatically deal with all the conversions that should be made with those weights and delays, in all simulators. Now only used within the projection class, but could be extended to the low-level api and therefore catch all the conversion there in a connect() call. Modification also of common.distances() to allow the calculus of the distances between one cell and all the others. Tests are passed and VAbenchmarks.py, adapted to the new Connectors, works

Modification of the Connector objects to allow handling of weights and delays directly in the connector, without the need to call setWeights and setDelays after the building of the connections.

* Added new standard cell: `AdaptiveExponentialIF_alpha` - only available in `nest2` for now. 
* Refactored recording and printing in `nest2` to reduce/eliminate duplicated code. This has not yet been well tested, and may be broken. 
* Fixed several of the standard cells in `nest2` so the IF_curr_alpha* and IF_curr_exp tests now pass. 
* Fixed the `connect()` function in `nest2` so it returns something useful rather than just `None`. It now returns a `Connection` object, which has a (partially implemented) `weight` property, and will have a `delay` property. Should consider making this object available in all modules, since the low-level API currently lacks a way of accessing/changing weights/delays of individual connections.

Correction of a bug in the compatible ouput of the Vm in NEST, due to a problem with the numpy.fromfile() function, not working in the same way according to Python version.

Merged [source:/branches/improved-ID@99 improved-ID branch] changes !r93:99 to trunk.

Changes to `ID` class:
  * `_cellclass` attribute renamed to `cellclass` and is now a [http://www.geocities.com/foetsch/python/new_style_classes.htm property].
  * Ditto for `_position` --> `position`
  * Methods `setPosition()`, `getPosition()`, `setCellClass()` removed (just use the `position` or `cellclass` properties).
  * `set(param,val=None)` changed to `setParameters(**parameters)`.
  * Added `getParameters()`
  * `__setattr__()` and `__getattr__()` overridden, so that cell parameters can be read/changed using dot notation, e.g. `id.tau_m = 20.0`

Note that one of the reasons for using properties is that it allows attributes to be created only when needed, hopefully saving on memory.

Changes to `Population` class:
  * Added `positions` property, which allows the positions of all cells in a population to be set/read at once as a numpy array.

Also note that all positions are now in 3D space.

Several changes performed in nest.py, pcsim.py and neuron.py. The threads can now be used in nest and pcsim, via the extra_param option of the setup() function. Moreover, the full classes IF_cond/curr_exp/alpha are now working with the three simulators, but to performed this you have to UPDATE pynest and to fix the CompositeLifNeuron.h file in pcsim. Others small bugs are corrected in the SpikeSourcePoisson in nest (duration pb), and to check the impact of all those changes on the tests. To do that, a uniformization of all the tests have been made, to check be sure to stress all the parameters for the models. A very rough test have also been added to test the SpikeSourcePoisson model, but is still not finished

VAbenchmarks.py now runs with NEURON, NEST and PCSIM. Yay!

PCSIM does not yet support using a `NumpyRNG` instance to determine the connections, so the connectivity is not the same as in NEURON and NEST, but the spike statistics look convincingly similar.

Note that I have also added a `utility` module, which at the moment just contains a `notify()` function to send yourself an e-mail when the simulation has finished. Maybe this should go in NeuroTools?

The behaviour of the `run()` function in the `neuron` module has been changed to match the `nest` and `pcsim` modules, i.e., calling `run(simtime)` several times in succession will advance the simulation by `simtime` ms each time, whereas before, `neuron` would reset time to zero each time.

Numerous bug-fixes to pcsim.py. It now runs the IF_curr_exp.py test correctly. The main changes involve units. PCSIM seems to use SI units for everything (V,A, s, etc) whereas PyNN uses mV, nA, ms, etc. The conversions were not being done within PyNN. There is still (probably) a problem for synaptic weights, as the conversion factor from A to nA is 1e9 while that from S to uS is 1e6, but I haven't tested conductance-based synapses yet.

Change to neuron and oldneuron to match more closely the behaviour of nest and pcsim when the synapse_type argument is not given in connect(). Before, neuron would by default choose an excitatory synapse. Now, it chooses an inhibitory synapse if the weight is negative. None of this is very satisfactory. A thorough overall of synapse types is needed.

Modifications for the compatible outputs of pyNN.nest and pyNN.neuron, even for the low level API. The syntax of those compatible formats is still open, but a compatible_output parameter allow the user to keep the previous outputs of pyNN.nest. Note that you HAVE TO UPDATE your pynest version to deal with membrane potentials recordings. Morevoer, there is an attemp to add into pyNN the conductance based IF with alpha synapses, as it is defined in iaf_cond_neuron, but for the moment this type has not been too much tested. pyNN.nest does not allow to address excitatory or inhibitory synapses. Minors changed have also been performed to change the loop in range() into in xrange(), to save memory.

Changed the implementation of the nest.Population.locate() method to match the same method in neuron2. This implementation is much faster, and its speed no longer depends on Population size, but is less foolproof as it makes the assumption that the gids (returned by NEST) in the Population.cell array are always consecutive. I think this assumption is always valid, but a unit test is needed to check it.

Changed the behaviour of Population indexing in the nest module to be more consistent with the neuron2 module, in two ways. (i) Previously, addresses with negative addresses were accepted in nest.py, giving a wrap-around behaviour. Now, they raise an IndexError. (neuron2 raises an AssertionError, so we are not totally consistent yet). (ii) Previously, an integer index n signified the (n+1)th neuron in the population, e.g., p[99] would be the same as p[10,10] for a 10x10 population. Now, p[99] is the same as p[99,] and is only valid for a 1D population. The previous behaviour was quite nice, but it was perhaps confusing to have two different possibly types of argument.

* Addition of ID class (inherits from int), allowing syntax like p[3,4].set('tau_m',20.0) where p is a Population object.
* Many, many optimisations to neuron2.
* Improved logging facilities.
* Change to the storage of connection information in nest.Projection, to allow the implementation of saveConnections().
* Some bug-fixes (notably in refrac.mod).
* Many minor improvements.

The major change is that the neuron2 module now supports distributed simulations using NEURON compiled with both MPI and Python support. Note that a patch to the current version of NEURON is needed for this (contact Andrew for this).

Minor changes/fixes:
* Population[xx] syntax for getting individual cell ids improved. You can now write p[2,3] instead of p[(2,3)].
* v_init added as a parameter to the IF_curr_alpha, etc, models.
* Improvements to the HocToPy class in the neuron and neuron2 modules: notably, if you try to get a variable that doesn't exist, a Python exception, HocError, will be raised.
* Some refactoring of the neuron module to remove redundancies and make it easier to put comments in the log file.
* If synaptic delay is not specified, delays are now set to min_delay, not zero (d'oh!).

* A few small fixes due to updating to the latest version of pynest, which requires numpy version >= 1.0rc1.
* Improvements to wikidoc.py

Random number API allows keeping control of the random numbers used in simulations, by passing an RNG object as an argument to functions that use RNGs. random module has wrappers for NumPy RNGs and GSL RNGs, as well as a stub class to indicate the simulator's native RNG should be used (i.e., the Random class in hoc).

Added some files that were missed from the last commit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r29 | apdavison | 2006-10-31 15:07:41 +0100 (Tue, 31 Oct 2006) | 1 line

Assorted changes: filling-in unimplemented bits of the API, some bug-fixes in the hoc files, beginnings of a project to make the use of random number generators more consistent.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r28 | apdavison | 2006-10-25 11:20:36 +0200 (Wed, 25 Oct 2006) | 1 line

Changed the version number to 0.2, to reflect the API change (models passed as classes instead of strings).

Major change: translation of model and parameter names from standardised names to simulator-specific names now uses one class per neuron model, rather than a single class with one method per model.
For users, the only difference is that you have to use, e.g.,
create(IF_curr_alpha)
instead of
create('IF_curr_alpha')
i.e., pass the class instead of a string.
For developers, it should now be easier to add new standard models. Much of the code has now been factored out into common.py, for a saving of about 100 lines of code overall.

* Can now use simulator-native cell types, not just 'Standard Cells'.
* A few other small changes.

* Changed calls to numpy.shape(), since this has changed between numpy version 0.9.6. and 1.0rc1
* Set $Id:$ substitution for all files

Added IF_curr_exp.py test, together with Vogels-Abbott benchmarks
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r14 | apdavison | 2006-09-21 13:05:20 +0200 (Thu, 21 Sep 2006) | 3 lines

* Added IF_curr_exp standard model, and associated test.
* Large changes related to the need to be able to have both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the same cell, and the need to be able to specify which of these a given presynaptic cell connects to.
Note that previous versions of VAbenchmark2 were incorrect, because of the above.

* One minor change to the API:
-    def randomInit(self,randobj):
+    def randomInit(self,func,*params):

* Added unit tests for nest and neuron modules

* Added various functional tests, which test the equivalence of NEURON and NEST.

* Implemented some more of the API in nest and neuron modules

* Assorted bugfixes
